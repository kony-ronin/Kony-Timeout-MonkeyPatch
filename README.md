# Timeouts polyfill for the Kony Platform

Defines the `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` functions for non-browser
environments -i.e. Native mobile. This helps the Kony platform play
nice with other javascript modules that might depend on these function definitions â€”e.g. Promises polyfills and Kris Kowal's Q.

## Implementation Notes:

1. Uses the `eval` function to avoid declaring the `setTimeout` or `clearTimeout` functions unless it's necessary. Declaring it and not initializing it will lead to breaking the natively defined namespace on browser environments, and the global `this` variable does not exist in native Kony apps.

2. Can't wrap in closure notation as there seems to be no global variable -equivalent to `window` or `self`- in non-browser environments, so there would be nothing to attach it to. Therefore it just has to be declared as a global variable.

3. Prefix `aaa` to module name is important to try and force this to be loaded before any other javascript libraries that might be dependent `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` being already defined.
